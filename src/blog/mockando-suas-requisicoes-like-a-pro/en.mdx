Mocking your back-end's requests on front-end side might by very useful on development and I'll show you two ways you can do this.

### Advantages to mock your requests

- Navigate and develop without rely on back-end.
- Write E2E tests on your application.
- Save time without await async requests.
- Save requests when you use a public API with limited requests.
- Develop faster with the data that your need.

In my job we saved money setting up a demo enviroment of your project using mocks on front-end without infrastruture to back-end.

### Disadvantage

I also have to say the only drawback that I see, it might be hard to keep your mocks updated if you have too much requests and your backend changes frequently.

For this example I'll create a listing page. How I'm just talking about requests, you can use it with _React, Angular, Vue, Vanilla_ or whatever framework you want.

First all, let's create our mock file.

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "John"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mike"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now let's create our service methods to fetch that data.

```javascript
import userMocks from "./userMocks.json";
const mockRequests = true;
const BASE_URL = "https://www.you-api.com";

const returnAsPromise = (mock) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => resolve(mock));
};

export const fetchAllUsers = () => {
  if (mockRequests) {
    return returnAsPromise(userMocks);
  }

  return fetch(`${BASE_URL}/all-users`);
};

export const fetchSingleUser = (id) => {
  if (mockRequests) {
    return returnAsPromise(userMocks.users[0]);
  }

  return fetch(`${BASE_URL}/single-user?id=${id}`);
};
```

This way we just need to change the variable _mockRequests_ to mock our requests or not.

### Using axios-mock-adapter

A better alternative might be use the npm package _axios-mock-adapter_. It must be used with _axios_, which is a very known npm package to HTTP requests.

#### Installing our dependencies.

```bash
npm install axios axios-mock-adapter
```

#### Setting up our mock file like this:

```javascript
import MockAdapter from "axios-mock-adapter";
import userMock from "./mock";

const useMock = (axios) => {
  const mock = new MockAdapter(axios);

  mock.onGet(/all-users/).reply(200, userMock);
  mock.onGet(/single-user/).reply(200, userMock.users[0]);
};

export default useMock;
```

If you read the _axios-mock-adapter_ documentation, it has some methods like `onGet`, `onPost`, `onPut`, `onDelete` which receive the endpoint to mock and with `reply` is possible return the status code and the response.

#### Import it and use it in our service file.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import useMock from "./useMock";

const mockRequests = true;
const baseURL = "https://api.themoviedb.org";

const client = axios.create({
  baseURL,
});

if (mockRequests) {
  useMock(client);
}

export const fetchAllUsers = () => {
  return client.get("/all-users");
};

export const fetchSingleUser = (id) => {
  return client.get(`/single-user?id=${id}`);
};
```

### Tips

It would be better put the **mockRequests** variable in the .env file, with this we can enable/disable the mock responses very quickly.

```bash
MOCK_REQUESTS=ALL
```

```javascript
const mockRequests = process.env.MOCK_REQUESTS === "ALL";
```

You can import your mock config inside your condition to check the mockRequests and NODE_ENV to avoid putting your mock files on your final bundle.

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && mockRequests) {
  const useMock = require("./mockConfig");
  useMock(client);
}
```
