My name is Sérgio, I am a Front End Developer for 5 years, although, I also work with Backend and Mobile Development when necessary in my job. I normally work with HTML, CSS and Javascript, using React and its solutions, depending on what I am working on. I already worked as a freelancer, in startups, big companies and now I am working remotely in an agency from Brazil.

I also have been writing in [a blog](http://diariodeumcrohnista.com.br/) for 5 years about Crohn’s Disease, after I was diagnosticated. I also recorded a few [podcast’s episodes](https://open.spotify.com/show/1bBEJfb7HTj3rKrehJEFbd) about it. I lived in Ireland for 7 months to study English last year and it was the craziest experience I have ever had so far.

I love cats, movies, books, especially those written by [Yuval Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/), music, I play guitar and ukulele. I have a degree in IT Management and before that, I almost went to study History to become a teacher. I still love it but as a hobby, such as Science in general.

This will be a place to share what I am working on, learning or my thoughts about technology, not only code. While you are here, feel free to see my [articles](https://www.sergiojunior.com.br/en/blog) or getting in touch with me through those links on footer below.
