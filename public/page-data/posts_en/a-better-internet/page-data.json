However, I would like to share my experience and opinion about internet as a web developer and user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may have endless good reasons to love the internet; it closer people, it allows access information easyly, simplify proccess that I done before with more efford (such as shopping, paying bills, checking our bank account). Internet is in a huge part of ours lives and tends to become even more present in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, companies and politicians also use it to their own benefits and not so much to good of people. I know that there is not a book with Internet&#8217;s commandments and how it must be used, however, as a person that always tries to do something good, I truly believe we, developers, should take advantage of our ability to reach so many people and positively influence their lives with our jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As developers, we always contribute with open source community, we try to solve problems or improve products that we&#8217;re working on. What if we take these abilities beyond our job to build a better internet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me give my example, In 2014 I was diagnosticated with Crohn&#8217;s disease, a autoimune inflammatory illness with no cure, at that time I barely found information about it and after had learnt how to live with the disease, I decided to create <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"a simple blog (abre numa nova aba)\" href=\"http://diariodeumcrohnista.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\">a simple blog</a> with WordPress to share everything that I&#8217;d learnt. Through that blog I helped plenty of patience, I made friends and I was invited to participate in events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also made work volunteer with homeless in SÃ£o Paulo city with a non-governmental organization and I built <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"their website (abre numa nova aba)\" href=\"https://www.institutogas.org.br/\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a> for free to their have more visibility and investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example, we are currently passing through a coronavirus pandemic and on the 27th, 28th and 29th of March happened the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"#CodeVsCOVID19 (abre numa nova aba)\" href=\"https://www.codevscovid19.org/\" target=\"_blank\">#CodeVsCOVID19</a>, an online marathon with hundreds of developers, designers, mentors from over the world, working together in teams to create solutions for people who are being affected by the coronavirus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I even built <a href=\"https://coronavirus-agora.netlify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"a website (abre numa nova aba)\">a website</a> showing the numbers of infected, deaths and recovered people in Brazil and worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These opportunities are great to start learning a new stack, a different project&#8217;s architecture, beside increase your portfolio as a developer and help other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are endless causes that we may help, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blinded people.</li><li>Elderly people.</li><li>Orphan children</li><li>Refugees.</li><li>Homeless.</li><li>Climate change.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t propose to end all these problems but to facilitate them through the Internet, be it connecting people, raising funds, sharing information. One thing I have been learning these years working with other developers is that we are great at thinking about solutions to problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we have the possibility to create a better Internet for everyone, and I&#8217;m not talking about performance or other technical metrics ðŸš€</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This won&#8217;t be a technical article, neither about a new stack or development metodology.
