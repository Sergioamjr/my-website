However, I would like to share my experience and opinion about internet as a web developer and user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may have endless good things about internet; it closer people, it allows access information easyly, simplify proccess that I done before with more efford (such as shopping, paying bills, checking our bank account). Internet is in a huge part of ours lives and tends to become even more present in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, companies and politicians also use it to their own benefics and not so much to good of people. I know that there is not a book with Internet&#8217;s commandments and how it must be used but as a person that always tries to do something good, I truly believe we should enjoy our capatibility of reaching so many people and influence their lives positivily with our jobs. Not just do code for code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As developers, we always contribute with open source community, we try to solve problems or improve products that we&#8217;re working on. What if we take these habilitties beyond our job to build a better internet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me give my example, In 2014 I was diagnosticated with Crohn&#8217;s disease, a autoimune inflammatory illness cureless, at that time I barely found information about it and after had learnt how to live with the disease, I decided to create a simple blog with WordPress to share everything that I&#8217;d learnt. Through that blog I helped plenty of patience, I made friends and I was invited to participate in events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also made work volunteer with homeless in SÃ£o Paulo city with a NGO and I built their website for free to their have more visibility and more investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These opportunities are great to start learning a new stack, a different project&#8217;s architecture, beside increase your portfolio as a developer and help other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick any cause that you are interested, like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blinded people.</li><li> Olders.</li><li>Refugees.</li><li>Homeless.</li><li>Children.</li><li>Climate change.</li><li>Share information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any idea or efford is important. We have capatibility to create a better internet and I&#8217;m not talking about perfommance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This won&#8217;t be a technical article, neither about a new stack or development metodology.
